//Kingfisher contains some general purpose types like Kingfisher.Image and Kingfisher.View. If you import the whole SwiftUI and Kingfisher at the same time, you will suffer from a name conflict. To avoid that, only import the necessary types from Kingfisher, such as import struct Kingfisher.KFImage or import class Kingfisher.KingfisherManager.
